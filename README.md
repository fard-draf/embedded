## Project Summary & Approach
This repository contains a collection of my embedded Rust projects. My main goal is to strengthen my low-level programming skills in Rust and prepare for more complex, large-scale embedded systems in the future.

To achieve this, I am developing a series of small, focused tools and applications. This hands-on approach allows me to explore different aspects of embedded development in a practical way.

### Current Projects:

- esp32-blink: A foundational "Hello, World!" project to control an ESP32's LED, ensuring the basic development environment and toolchain are correctly set up.

- esp32_bmp280: A more advanced project focused on interfacing with a BMP280 sensor. This involves working with hardware peripherals and external crates to read environmental data like temperature and pressure.

By building these projects, I am progressively building my expertise before taking on more ambitious challenges.
